            <p> Hi! My name is Louis Win a Senior taking West-Mec Coding at the NorthEast Campus,
                 I am currently in my first year in the program. I am learning the fundamentals 
                 of web development and coding. I am an aspiring entrepreneur and  
                 not afraid of learning new things. I am willing to dive into anything 
                 and open to all ideas! The skills I currently possess are basic html, css, and javascript skills.
                 Although my skillset in coding is small at the moment, My true skills are interpersonal skills. 
                 Talking and communicating to other people come easily to me. My interpersonal skills help me 
                 conect with my peers and solve disuputes easily. 
            </p>
